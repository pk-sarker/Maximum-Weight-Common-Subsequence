Maximum Weight Common Subsequence(MWCS)
=======================================

------------------
|    PROBLEM     |
------------------

 *  The Mutation Sensitive Alignment (MSA) algorithm computes in the rst step the MWCS               
 *  (Maximum Weight Common Subsequence) of the MUM sequences A and B obtained from the                 
 *  genomes G1 and G2, where each MUM is assigned a weight (could be its length or something          
 *  else). As in the slides, we can consider the MUM labels of one, say A, to be in canonical order    
 *  CS[1..n] and that of B in a permuted order PS[1..n]. An MWCS of CS[1..n] and PS[1..n] is          
 *  in increasing order and of maximum weight.
